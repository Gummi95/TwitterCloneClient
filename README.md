## About
- This is the frontend of my Twitter clone, the goal was to emulate the layout of twitter as well as possible. 
There is no funcionality in the side panels of the site, only the tweet sections are functional.
- I used pure CSS for the layout and look of the site but used Material UI for most of the icons.
- When you launch the site the Twitter login screen is the first thing you see, from there you can "login" to continue to the home screen.
- The home screen is split into three main components, Sidebar, Feed and Trending. from there you can like and post tweets and press a tweet to open it and see the comments

# TwitterCloneClient
This is the frontend for a Twitter clone that I created for a school project.
The goal was to emulate Twitter the best I could and feed data to it from an APi I made.
The project is written in React JS and CSS.
