# TwitterCloneClient
This is the frontend for a Twitter clone that I created for a school project.
The goal was to emulate Twitter the best I could and feed data to it from an APi I made.
The project is written in React JS and CSS.

## Setup
#### Git command to clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Gummi95/TwitterCloneClient.git
```
To run the project, install locally using npm
```
$ npm install
$ npm start 
```
